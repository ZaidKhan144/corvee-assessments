# Corvee Assessments

## CSS Assessment

Before starting, make sure you are logged in to CodePen, at the end of the test you will need to export your solution as a zip. The export function can be found in the bottom right corner.

The task is to implement the component seen in the image using only HTML and CSS.
You will be given 40 minutes to achieve as close to pixel perfection as possible while also ensuring good code quality.

The test is extremely stressful. It will show how comfortable you are with basic technologies. In order to get a good result in the time given you will need to work in an organized manner to avoid having to redo things over and over.

Implement the component as if you were actually going to use it, e.g. make the text field editable. No javascript is required.

The CSS editor is set to use Less as the preprocessor. You may change it to use SCSS should you prefer.

Everything needed to complete the task is available here. Don't remove any existing code, simply add your own. You are allowed to look up external references.

Your component will render as you type and be positioned beneath the image. If it is no longer updating you likely have a syntax error.


We hope you do well and thank you for taking the time!

## Algorithm Assessment

Write a function: function smallestInt(A);

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

Example: given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [-1, -3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

Write test cases to validate that your implementation conforms to the specification.

Additionally, implement the benchmark function to test the performance of your solution. The benchmark should be able to run in the browser and be capable of outputting a reasonably reliable score when comparing solutions in the same environment.

You will be evaluated based on:
- Correctness according to instructions
- Algorithmic efficiency
- Scope of test cases
- Code style and quality

You're advised to include any less efficient solutions or pseudo code definitions of such solutions in your final submission.

## Accessing The Assessment

For the CSS Assessment, it is crucial that you understand that there are many different ways to solve this and we are looking for a solution that is algorithmically efficient.  So bear in mind that there are multiple solutions that would not be considered good enough.

The CSS assessment will be sent to you in an automated email when you are ready to take it. You can code within codepen or in the editor of your choice.

Additional points:

- When you receive the test you get a few minutes to read instructions, then you must start. After you've seen it you cannot postpone.
- Please record your screen while you are coding your solution (Only need screen, no audio or camera).
- Please export the solution and send it to us. 
- From beginning to code they must stop in 40 minutes. (So within no more than 60 minutes from when they received the link we must have both video and solution.)
